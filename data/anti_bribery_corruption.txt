Anti-Bribery & Corruption — Wema Bank (Expanded)

Principles:
Wema Bank enforces a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. The policy applies to employees, agents, contractors, and third-party partners. The bank promotes ethical conduct and transparency across all operations.

Key Elements:
- Prohibition: No offer, solicitation, or acceptance of bribes in any form (cash, gifts, hospitality, facilitation payments) to influence business decisions.
- Gifts & hospitality: Reasonable and pre-approved gifts may be allowed under clear thresholds and recorded transparently.
- Third-party due diligence: Vendors and agents undergo vetting to ensure they meet anti-corruption standards.
- Reporting mechanisms: Confidential whistleblowing channels are established to report suspected breaches without fear of retaliation.
- Investigations: Allegations are investigated promptly by an independent function; disciplinary measures or legal action follow confirmed breaches.

Responsibilities:
- Senior management ensures a culture of compliance and provides resources for training and oversight.
- Employees complete mandatory anti-corruption training and declare conflicts of interest while following procurement rules.
- Third parties must comply contractually with anti-bribery clauses and allow audits when necessary.
