ALAT by Wema — Digital Banking Overview (Expanded)

ALAT is Wema Bank's fully-digital banking platform. It is designed to give customers an end-to-end banking experience on mobile and web without needing to visit a branch for routine tasks. Below are features, user journeys, safety measures, and tips for maximizing ALAT.

Core Features:
- Account opening: Fully digital onboarding with ID and BVN checks (where applicable).
- Savings goals: Create multiple goals, target amounts, and automated contributions.
- Card controls: Turn cards on/off, set limits, and monitor transactions in real time.
- Transfers: Instant transfers to local banks, scheduled payments, and beneficiary management.
- Bills & utilities: Pay electricity, cable, internet, and other recurring bills from the app.
- Loans & quick credit: Apply for small loans or instant credit products (subject to eligibility).
- Notifications: Real-time SMS/push notifications for transactions and security alerts.

User Experience & Flows:
- Registration: Download app, verify phone, complete KYC steps, and link BVN if required.
- Security: Login via PIN/biometrics (where available). Sensitive actions require re-authentication.
- Goals automation: Set recurring transfers into round-ups or scheduled debits that feed specific goals.
- Customer support: In-app chat and escalation pathways; some issues may require phone support or branch visits.

Security Practices:
- Never share OTPs, pins, or card details. ALAT will not ask for full PINs or OTPs via chat or email.
- Enable biometric login and use a device PIN to harden app access.
- Keep the app updated; new releases often patch vulnerabilities and improve fraud detection.
- Use in-app card controls to quickly pause card usage if compromised.

Troubleshooting & Best Practices:
- If a transaction fails, check network connectivity, app version, and beneficiary details. If uncertain, contact customer support with transaction references.
- Use strong unique passwords for your email and bank credentials.
- Regularly reconcile statements for business users to quickly spot anomalies.

ALAT for business:
- Business users can access payroll features, bulk payment tools, and reporting dashboards.
- APIs and integrations may be available for enterprise clients to automate collections and reconcile funds.

Regulatory disclaimers:
- Some features are subject to eligibility checks, local regulations, and banking hours for settlement (e.g., interbank transactions may settle on business days).
