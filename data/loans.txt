Repayment & Defaults:

Responsible lending guidance for customers:
- Borrow within means; ensure the repayment plan fits expected income.
- Understand interest rate type (fixed vs. variable) and all fees before signing up.
- Maintain open communication with the lender if repayment difficulties arise — banks may offer restructuring options.

Regulatory & Compliance notes:
- Loan products must adhere to local central bank regulations, disclosure standards, and consumer protection guidelines.
- Interest rate disclosures and all charges should be presented upfront during the application process.
