Fraud Prevention & Security — Wema Bank (Expanded)

Principles:
Wema Bank emphasizes proactive fraud detection, customer education, layered security, and rapid incident response. Fraud prevention is a shared responsibility: the bank provides tools and monitoring while customers follow safe practices.

Common Fraud Types:
- Phishing & vishing: Scams that solicit PINs, OTPs, or account information via email or phone.
- Card cloning & skimming: Fraudsters copy card details at compromised ATMs or POS terminals.
- Account takeover: Unauthorized access through credential compromise.
- Social engineering: Manipulating users into revealing sensitive data or making transfers.

Bank Measures:
- Transaction monitoring systems flag unusual patterns (velocity checks, geo anomalies, large transfers, rapid duplicate transactions).
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations and high-risk channels.
- Tokenization and encryption of card data on digital channels.
- Whistle-blowing and internal controls to detect insider risk.

Customer Actions & Guidance:
- Never share OTPs, PINs, or full card details with anyone.
- Use in-app controls to limit card use and freeze cards when suspicious.
- Verify unsolicited contact: legitimate bank channels rarely request full PINs or OTPs.
- Immediately report suspected fraud through official support channels and retain transaction references for disputes.

Incident Response:
- Report: Contact customer care and provide transaction details and timestamps.
- Investigation: The bank will investigate, sometimes engaging law enforcement and cyber forensic specialists.
- Reversal & remediation: For validated fraudulent transactions, funds may be reversed depending on investigation findings and policy.

Education & Awareness:
- Regular campaigns to inform customers about emerging scam tactics.
- Tutorials on using app security features, recognizing fake websites, and safe online shopping.
